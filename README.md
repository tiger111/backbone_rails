Backbone.js Authentication UI with Ruby on Rails and Devise
===========================================================



This is an example application that implements a user regisration, authentication, and password retrieval
user interface using [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

The front end also takes advantage of a few additional Backbone support libraries which include:

* [backbone.marionette](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette)
* [backbone.modelbinder](https://github.com/theironcook/Backbone.ModelBinder)
* [backbone-rails's Backbone.sync implementation](https://github.com/codebrew/backbone-rails)
